# KWS-SoC
This is an accelerating kernel of neural network based on wujian100. Specially, the accelerating kernel is designed for Keyword Spotting(KWS). Thus far, the current version is only for `testbench`.
## QUICK START ##
This repository includes folders as following:<br>
`cmodel`: <br>
  * `my_audio.py`: This is a python script for preprocessing data. <br>
  * `test_mymodel_myaudio.py`: This is a python script to generate software comparison data. <br>
  * `test_list.txt`: This file contains the label information of the test files in the dataset. <br>
  * `ds_rnn_labels.txt`: This is a mapping table between results and labels. <br> 
  * `data.dat`: This is 40 groups of floating point input data after preprocessing. <br>
  * `result.dat`: This is 40 groups of floating point result data after software computing. <br>
 `tools`:  <br>
  * `float2hex`: This is a script for transforming all 40 groups floating point input data into hex data and distributing to 40 test folders.<br>
  * `result_div`: This is a script for distributing all 40 groups floating point reference result data into 40 test folders.<br>
  * `hex2float`: This is a script for transforming each kws result hex data generated by KWS-SoC into floating point data, and displaying a result label. 
`soc`: This folder includes source code of KWS-SoC.<br>
`tb`: This folder includes testbench code of KWS-SoC.<br> 
`wujiankws.*`: These folders include Vivado project files, such as ip source codes and simulation scripts. <br>
`test.pat`: This is a hexadecimal file generated by compiling C file generation instruction and linking of wujian100 platform, which is used for core execution. The  generation method of this file can refer to the [wujian100 platform](https://github.com/T-head-Semi/wujian100_open)
