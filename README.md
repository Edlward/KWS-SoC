# KWS-SoC
This is a SoC for neural-network acceleration based on [wujian100_open](https://github.com/T-head-Semi/wujian100_open) platform, which is a low power open source MCU by T-Head. Specially, the accelerating kernel is designed for Keyword Spotting(KWS) and the preprocess kernel is also integrated. Thus far, the current version has been verified on T-HEAD development board using CDK.
## NEW FEATURES ##
1.   Integrated the IP of KWS and PREPROCESS to wujian100.
2.   A modify to KWS IP, reduce the weight and resouce utilization.
3.   The input data is transmitted by uart (Baudrate 115200,non parity,databits 8).
4.   This version of KWS-SOC has been verified on T-HEAD development board.

## QUICK START ##
This repository includes folders as following:<br>
`soc`: This folder includes source code of KWS-SoC.<br>
  
`ip`: This folder includes preprocess ip and KWS ip.<br>

`constrain`: This folder includes constraint files.<br>

`sdk`:This folder includes software files.<br>

`testdata`:<br>
  * `test1.wav`: This is tested audio file.<br>
  * `test2.wav`: This is tested audio file.<br>
  * `wujian100_kws_serial.py`: This is a python script for reading wav files and send the input data to board using uart.
  
`cfg.bit`: This is a bitstream file generated by Vivado based on project KWS-SOC.

 ### Steps ###
1.   Download the `cfg.bit` to T-HEAD development board.<br>
2.   Open the cdk project in `sdk` folder, and download the software to the development board.<br>
3.   Run the `wujian100_kws_serial.py` to read wav file and send the data to the board. First you need to change the com config to the com you used in `line 7` <br>.
	```ser=serial.Serial('com5',115200,timeout=1) ```<br>
4.   Read the results sent back from the board.<br>
